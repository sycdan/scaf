# Scaf Development Roadmap

**Note:** Ignore commented blocks (surrounded by <!-- -->).

**Note:** Always use TDD (write a failing test, then make it pass).

## Feature Requests

I would like scaf discover to add aliases to the selected deck's aliases file for the discovered actions, if those actions are not aliased already.
Then, it should parse all raw aliases from the aliases file, reporting any failures as warning logs.
Then it should print those aliases to the terminal with the alias name highlighted red and the action shape's docstring, like normal cli help. When the alias is parsed though, it should info log the aliased command (e.g. 'scaf call $DECK/*') so the use can see the raw command they can run if the alias is not active in their shell.

## Today's Task

## Bug reported by user



## Goals

- [ ] add an example to the `example` domain, if necessary
- [ ] write an integration test that proves the bug exists (name the test file bug/tests/test_<%Y%m%d%H%M>.py as in other bug tests)
- [ ] fix the bug
- [ ] ensure the test passes
- [ ] commit and push -->
